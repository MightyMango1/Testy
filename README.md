## Project Description
 Why is it important or interesting to you?
 > Our project is important because it helps academic achievers effectively study by reinforcing concepts in a fun and interactive way. Testy has the potential to transform how people learn and retain information. As developers, we're passionate about developing tools that make studying more engaging and accessible, and we find it fascinating how technology can be leveraged to personalize learning experiences for each user. With features like custom quizzes, spaced repetition, and flashcards, the app can adapt to individual learning styles, helping users study more efficiently and retain knowledge longer.

 What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)</u>
 > C++ for the backend, Next.js & TailwindCSS for the frontend.
> We will use Next-auth for login authentication
> MongoDB will act as the database to store user flashcard sets

 What will be the input/output of your project?
 >  Input will be buttons and text input from our UI. <br>
 > Output will be flashcards that the user had previously created.

 What are the features that the project provides?
 > - Account Creation and login
>  - Creating flashcard sets
 > - Adding and saving flashcards
 > - deleting flashcards
 > - editing flashcards
 > - creating quizzes using existing flashcards from a set

> The navigation diagram shows the main functionality of the application and what to do in order to access each specific function (e.x profile or create new sets).

> Home Page: Shares the same navigation bar as most other pages. Main functions are to give a brief overview of the application and to bring the user to "Study Sets" page or login/signup page.

> Login and Signup pages: Does not include a navigation bar; only a button to return to the home page. Main function is to log the user into the application or sign up if they don't already have an account in the DB.

 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * Make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
>  * Each team member should also submit the Individual Contributions Form on Canvas for phase III. In this form, you need to fill in the names of all team members, the percentage of work contributed by each member for phase III, and a description of their contributions. Remember that each team member should submit the form individually.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history.
>  * Each team member should also submit the Individual Contributions Form on Canvas for this final phase. In this form, you need to fill in the names of all team members, the percentage of work contributed by each member for the final phase, and a description of their contributions. Remember that each team member should submit the form individually.
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
